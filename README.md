# Csharp-Newproj-Templates

Some useful templates for new csharp projects:

- [TrayConsoleDemo] A tray app, based on a .NET core console. This is quite useful, if you want your app to be running in background, while still maintaining maximum cross-platform features.

- [ServiceConsoleDemo] A service app, based on a .NET core console. When this app launches, it establishes itself as a windows service. Useful for applications, that are running in the background and provide data.
